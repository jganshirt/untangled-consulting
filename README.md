FEWD - FINAL PROJECT


WELCOME TO MY FINAL PROJECT FOR FRONT END WEB DEVELOPMENT.

THIS SITE IS A VERY BASIC ATTEMPT AT MAKING A WEBSITE FOR A FRIEND WHO DOES BUSINESS ABROAD.

LINKS WILL CONTINUE TO BE WORKED ON UNTIL THEY GO TO NEW CONTENT. WAITING FOR MY COUNTERPART TO GIVE ME MORE CONTENT.

JAVASCRIPT IS A COUNT-UP TIMER/VISIT.



IN THE FUTURE, LOOKING TO ADD MORE IMAGES RELEVANT TO MY FRIEND'S BUSINESS, CHANGE COLOR SCHEMES,
INCORPORATE BOOTSTRAP, AND CLEAN UP THE AESTHETICS. WHICH MAY LEAD ME TO STARTING A NEW WEBSITE ALTOGETHER,
BUT IT HAS BEEN FUN.
